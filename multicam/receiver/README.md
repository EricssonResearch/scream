# Receiver side build instructions

On the receiver side it is assumed that gstreamer is already installed.

The SCReAM receiver side is built with the instructions:

    cd scream
    cmake . && make
    cd ..

#Startup

In the terminal:<br>
`$ ./startvideo.sh`<br>

To ensure proper function it is recommended to start the sender side first, then the receiver side. Or more correctly, the remote end that is connected to a cellular modem should be started first. This can avoid issues with remapped ports.

To stop the programs, in the terminal:<br>
`$ ./killitall.sh`<br>

#Streaming status
Streaming status is printed on stdout and also transmitted on UDP port 30200, this can be used for instance to visualize bitrate, RTT, packet loss etc in a graphical user interface
An example of streaming status is:
