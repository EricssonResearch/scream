/*
* This module implements the receiver side of SCReAM.
* As SCReAM is a sender based congestion control, the receiver side is
*  actually dumber than dumb. In essense the only thing that it does is to
*  + Record receive time stamps and RTP sequence numbers for incoming RTP packets
*  + Generate RTCP feedback elements
*  + Calculate an appropriate RTCP feedback interval
* See https://github.com/EricssonResearch/scream/blob/master/SCReAM-description.pptx
*  for details on how it is integrated in audio/video platforms.
* A full implementation needs the additional code for
*  + Other obvious stuff such as RTP payload depacketizer, video+audio deoders, rendering, dejitterbuffers
* It is recommended that RTCP feedback for multiple streams are bundled in one RTCP packet.
*  However as low bitrate media (e.g audio) requires a lower feedback rate than high bitrate media (e.g video)
*  it is possible to include RTCP feedback for the audio stream more seldom. The code for this is T.B.D
*
* Internal time is represented as the mid 32 bits of the NTP timestamp (see RFC5905)
* This means that the high order 16 bits is time in seconds and the low order 16 bits
* is the fraction. The NTP time stamp is thus in Q16 i.e 1.0sec is represented
* by the value 65536.
* All internal time is measured in NTP time, this is done to avoid wraparound issues
* that can otherwise occur every 18 hour or so
